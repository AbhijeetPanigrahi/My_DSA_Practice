A lambda function is a small, anonymous (unnamed) function defined using the keyword lambda instead of def.
It is typically used when you need a short function for a short time—usually as an argument to another function.
It can take any number of arguments but only one expression, whose result is returned automatically.

They are commonly used with:
sort(), sorted()
map()
